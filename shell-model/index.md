# Overview
The most straightforward concept of the atom is the shell model, first proposed by Niels Bohr.

A nucleus contains protons and neutrons. Protons carry a positive charge, and neutrons carry no charge. The nucleus is surrounded by shells of negatively-charged electrons.

Each shell can only hold a fixed number of electrons, and each shell essentially represents a principal energy level. The electrons orbit around the nucleus. 

(Quantum physics has shown this is more of an electron cloud, and there is a limit to how precise one can simultaneously know the position or momentum of a particle; aka the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. For now though, we are only concerned with the Bohr shell model.)

## Example
The calcuim atom contains 20 protons and 20 neutrons.

The uranium atom contains 92 protons, the number of neutrons will be different if the atom is $$^{235}U$$ or $$^{238}U$$.

Each electron shell is label by its principal quantum number; e.g., 1, 2, 3, 4, etc., with the lower number closer to the nucleus.
