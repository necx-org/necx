    text: Derive the decay equation for a three member chain (A, B, C), where the third member is a stable nuclide. At what time is the activity of B maximized? Based on the three member decay chain, when will secular equilibrium be reached if $\lambda_A$ << $\lambda_B$ or if $\lambda_B$ << $\lambda_A$? How is secular equilibrium useful? See [Section 1.0](https://courses.candelalearning.com/x84x9/) in the OER for information on the Bateman equations.
