# Formatting Assessment Activities

Assessment activities may take many formats, depending on the type of
assessment.  Some assessment types include:

* multiple choice questions
* matching questions
* sorting questions
* numerical analysis or simulation
* short answer questions
* quantitative engineering problems
* essay question

Where appropriate, a standard format will be established for each type of
question to facilitate automated processing and translation of these questions
into final rendered formats.  These formats will be defined below.

To the extent possible, widely-adopted standard formats for representing
assessment activities will chosen for use here, rather than developing new
standard formats.

In some cases, a format specficiation will primarily refer to a file format
(e.g. Jupyter Notebook), and in other cases the specification will refer to
the structure of data within a text file.
