# Node Syntax Reference and Style Guide

This document serves as the official reference for the structure of a node as
well as a style guide for filling that structure.

## Node

The fundamental unit of the Nuclear Engineering Curriculum Exchange is a
"Node".  Two types of nodes are defined:

* Interior nodes contain the bulk of the contained in the exchange
* Boundary nodes define prerequisite material that is not included in the exchnage

The two node types are distinguished by which [metadata][#metadata] appears in
the file.

Each node is in its own directory with a name identical to its uuid (see
below).  That directory must contain a file called `index.md`.  All interior
nodes must also contain a sub-directory called
[`assessments`](assessment-formats.md).

Each node may contain [other elements](#additional-elements), either as
optional metadata or additional files linked from the `index.md` file.

## Syntax of `index.md` file

The `index.md` file is a markdown file with YAML-formatted metadata at the
top, delimited with `---`, followed by [content](#content) that serves as
instructor notes for the node.

### Metadata

For a complete description of YAML formatting for metadata, see
[the YAML specification](http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html).  This
section defines specific metadata and its meaning.  The metadata components
may appear in any order.

#### Required Metadata

Every node is required to have the following metadata:

* _title_: A human readable title for the node.  Titles should be unique,
  descriptive, short, and capitalized.

  e.g. `title: A NECX Node Template`

* _uuid_ : A universally unique identifier formatted as words joined with
  hyphens, and often similar to the title.  UUIDs should be unique,
  descriptive, short, and lowercase.

  e.g. `uuid: necx-node-template`

#### Required Metadata for Internal Nodes

The following metadata are required for all internal nodes, and its presence
identifies the node as an internal node rather than a boundary node.

* _learning objective_: A phrase indicating the learning objective of the
  node.  Each node is expected to have a single learning objective.

  e.g.
```
learning objective:
   construct a node with the correct syntax and contents
```

* _prerequisites_: A list of node uuids that are considered prerequisite
  knowledge for this node.  All prerequisites must be present in the exchange,
  whether as other interior nodes or as boundary nodes.

  e.g.
```
prerequisites:
    - other-content
    - another-node
```

* _assessments_: A list of assessment activities that allow a student to
  demonstrate their compitency with the learning objective.  Each assessment
  is stored in a separate subdirectory within he `assessments` subdirectory.
  The name of that subdirectory should be a unique identifier (uid), but only
  unique within this node.  The entries in the metadata list are the uid
  subdirector names.  There must be at least one assessment.  Individual
  assessments may take on [many formats](assessement-formats.md).

  e.g.
```
assessments:
  - a-multiple-choice-question
  - a-notebook-problem
  - write-an-essay
```

### Content

Markdown formatted content files for each node contain the lecture
material/instructor notes for the subject matter.

Syntax for the file should adhere to the following guidelines:
1. No html tags
2. Use latex tags for equations; i.e., $e^{-\lambda t}$ or $$e^{-\lambda t}$$
3. Images should be stored in an `img` subdirectory within the parent node directory


## Additional Elements

In addition to the required node elements, many elements are recommended and
should be incorporated into the `index.md` file as metadata, links,
references, or otherwise.

- Text, equations
- Nomenclature
- Example code
- References
- External readings
- Instructor guidance
- Graphics
- Videos
- Audio files
- Worked Examples
- List of ABET a-k objectives supported
- Active Learning activities
- Demonstration
- Code completion exercises
- Think pair share questions
- Other learning outcomes
