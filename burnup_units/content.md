# Units for nuclear fuel burnup

The most common units for nuclear fuel burnup are $MW_{th}d/tonne$.  A burnup
of $5 MW_{th}d/tonne$ would describe a fuel that has operated at some power
level over a period of time.  For example,

* $1 MW_{th}/tonne$ for 5 days,
* $5 MW_{th}/tonne$ for 1 day, or
* $25 MW_{th}/tonne$ for 0.2 days.

Since specific power may be measured in other units, these could also be
written as:

* $1 W_{th}/g$ for 5 days,
* $5 W_{th}/g$ for 1 day, or
* $25 W_{th}/g$ for 0.2 days.
